1. Why ArgoCD is beneficial for deploying applications
  - Git as the single source of truth
  - automatically syncs cluster state with Git
  - supports rollbacks by reverting Git commits
  - works well with helm

2. Why mTLS is valuable in Kubernetes clusters
  - encrypts service-to-service traffic
  - works without app code changes
  - prevents unauthorized pod communication

3. When Argo CD should NOT be used and why
  - very small single-service cluster
  - short-lived tests
  - applications requiring manual control

4. When mTLS / Service Mesh should NOT be used and why
  - Simple applications with minimal security needs
  - Short-lived or non-production environments
  - When network security is already enforced externally
